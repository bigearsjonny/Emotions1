# Emotions1
Goal: 
	Accurately detect emotion from facial expression from the dataset

Givens: 
	The dataset located at www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge
	The images in the dataset are 48x48 pixel grey scale images

Comments:
	There were some difficult aspects to this project. 
	
Results:
	I managed to obtain 81.32% accuracy on the test data.
	
Future Work:
	- Work with only a subset of data because the full data set takes a long time to process
	- After 50 epochs, there was not much improvmenent in training
	- detects only 1 emotion, detecting all emotions in the dataset will be better
